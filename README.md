Notes on [**asterism**](https://asterism.neetocode.com/site/nidhi-singh-rathore/01JZP27CXXVNVJSP67HKQCJMKD)

# Affinities
This is a thought experiment/sketch to extend **asterism** such that image boards can be be iterated along three axes:
1. **formal affinities** - morphology, color, medium/technology
2. **conceptual affinities** - subject matter, intentions, associations, influences
3. **historical affinities** - date of creation, provenance, contemporary events

We propose using generative AI to build a graph udnerlying a recommendation system.

A graph of all images from the selected databases that maps them into a space then allows identification of where a specific image falls relative to all others, and 'recommend' images of varying (user-specified?) adjacency on an axis from nearest neighbor to most distant.

# Additional app features for consideration
+ add scaling
+ add Z-position
+ add rotation
+ add citation (copy to clipboard)
+ add image download (best res)
+ add export board to .PDF
+ add HSB controls
+ add alpha
